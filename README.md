# What is ICGC's Jupyter Notebooks site?

It's a place where you can get started running our APIs and data, using only your web browsr! 

Just navigate to [https://jupyterhub.cancercollaboratory.org](), log in, and get started! Everything you run is contained within your own virtual machine, so you can't break anything; so feel free to experiment, learn, and explore!

Once there, you can fetch data, run analyses using R and Python, and chart real world results. 

Be sure to check out our demonstration notebook to see how easy it is to get started!

# What do I need to get started?

You need DACO authorization and a google email address -- use the same one that you use to sign in to our web <portal> to sign in.

Once you do, you will have access to your own private sandbox in which you can write scripts and demonstrate results in Python or R.

Each user's account runs independently on it's own virtual Linux server; you can access a command line terminal from your web browser, and get familiar with what our cancer collaboratory cloud services are capable of.

The Jupyter Notebooks platform sandbox is intended as just that: a place to learn, explore, experiment, and get aquainted with our APIs and data sets. 

# What this site is not...

The ICGC Jupyter Notebooks are only intended as a "sandbox" environment;  a place to learn, explore, experiment, and get aquainted with our APIs and data sets. 

The site is designed as a starting point for researchers to test out proofs of concept, and explore ideas, and get to know aspects of our systems and APIs, but not as a computation-heavy platform for bioinformatics research. 

It is also not, in any way, intended to be a persistent, robust, or production-ready environment. There are no guarantees of availability or persistence at any given point in time. 

##In particular, please note that all Jupyter notebook acounts and configurations will be automatically deleted on a weekly basis.

Users should be aware they will need to download and save copies of any notebooks they wish to keep onto their own computers, and upload them back again whenever necessary.

The idea of the site is designed as a starting point or researchers to test out proofs of concept, and explore ideas, and get to know aspects of our systems and APIs, but not as a rigorous platform for scientific research. 

# When you want real power...

Jupyter Notebooks are great for getting started; but what do you do once you need more? What if your research requires you to run heavy-duty bioinformatics computations against multiple files in parallel, on a fast, powerful cloud-based computing system? 

Don't worry! That's exactly what our Cancer Genome Collaboratory system was designed for; it's a distributed computing powerhouse with over 2,500 CPU cores, 7.7 PB of storage, and over 900 TB of cancer genomics data!
