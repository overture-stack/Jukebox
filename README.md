## Introduction

Jukebox is a simple way of deploying JupyterHub to your team's Openstack cloud. We have gone ahead and created playbooks and roles for ansible that will allow you to launch a VM, configure it with the required packages, deploy certificates, and finally allow your users to login with their google IDs!
